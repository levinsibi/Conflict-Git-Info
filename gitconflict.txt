After merge make sure that you have all new changes in master .if missed it will be lost
All contents in master should be in branch.else it thinks like new branch deleted this content from master.(while merging)

while merging there wont be any issue for elements common in master and branch

it will ultimately show truncated result from master(that is shown in branch) and what is now new in master and what is new in branch

//branch
System.out.println(44);
		System.out.println(64);
		System.out.println(84);
		System.out.println(94);
		
		System.out.println(6);
		System.out.println(8);
		System.out.println(9);
		System.out.println(4);
//master
System.out.println(47);
		System.out.println(4);
		System.out.println(6);
		System.out.println(8);
		System.out.println(9);


while merging above two

a.<<<<<<< HEAD
		System.out.println(44);
		System.out.println(64);
		System.out.println(84);
		System.out.println(94);
		
b.=======
		System.out.println(47);
		System.out.println(4);
c.>>>>>>> refs/heads/master
		System.out.println(6);
		System.out.println(8);
		System.out.println(9);
		System.out.println(4);

a-b shows content which are only available in branch
b-c shows contents which are only available in master.4 is shown since its position varied from master
below c are contents which are available both.
For merge always eliminate duplicates from c (compare with section b-c) then add it with section a-b
after conflicts are resolved commit and push.then put pull request.
